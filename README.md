Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
=================================================

Learning Scala, I am inspired to deepen my understanding of the the
functional programing paradigm, specifically through Chicken Scheme.

These files represent my notes as I work through SICP using Chicken.
Each file represents one chapter-section in the book, and is a
combination of notes (written as comments), sample code, and
exercises, in the spirit of literate programming.
